**PROJECT NAME:** 
KOFY HOUSE - *an online coffee shop / store*

**DESCRIPTION:** 
The goal of the Kofy House project was to create a functional front-end online store where a user can see what we are about, visit a store where coffee brewing machines, beans and books are available. Load the items to a cart, obtain a real time total bill and simulate a purchase checkout for all the items.  

**TABLE of CONTENTS:** Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.

**INSTALLATION:** Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

**USAGE:** [usageImg] The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after theyâ€™ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.
