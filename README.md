**DESCRIPTION:** 
The goal of the Kofy House project was to create a functional front-end online store where a user can see what we are about, visit a store where coffee brewing machines, beans and books are available. Load the items to a cart, obtain a real time total bill and simulate a purchase checkout for all the items.
