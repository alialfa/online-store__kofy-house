## PROJECT NAME:
** KOFY HOUSE - *(an online coffee store)*

## DESCRIPTION: 
The goal of the Kofy House project was to create a functional front-end online store where a user can see what we are about, visit a store where coffee brewing machines, beans and books are available. Load the items to a cart, obtain a real time total bill and simulate a purchase checkout for all the items.  

## INSTALLATION:
This project requires no installation as it is a series of interlinked html pages.
Clone it to your local repo, navigate to the main folder and run the 'index.html' file, this will open the site's landing page in your browser. 

## USAGE:
After you have this locally in your machine, all navigation occurs in the browser.
