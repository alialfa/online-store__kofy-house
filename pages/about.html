            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Kofy House is an online store for South African coffee lovers. You can order freshly roasted coffee beans from some of SA's best artisan roasters as well as a broad selection of coffee makers, coffee grinders and accessories, delivered by courier, anywhere
                in the country.
            </p>

                <h2>The Coffee Beans</h2>
                <p>Our journey began with the beans. One of the most important factors in making a great coffee is using freshly roasted beans and grinding them just before you brew, no matter how you make your coffee. Knowing this, our very first goal was
                    to give all of South Africa access to high quality, fresh coffee beans.</p>
                <p>Teaming with incredibly talented artisanal roasters, some of whom are starting to earn an international reputation. Unfortunately, getting a hold of the coffee they roast, particularly soon after roast date, can be a bit tricky if they're
                    not nearby. So we started this business by working with some of the very best roasters and delivering their beans across the country.</p>

            <article>
                <h2>The Coffee Grinders & Brewing Equipment</h2>
                <p>It wasn't long after we started delivering coffee beans that we began looking to add to our selection. We only sell whole bean coffee (that's the best way to enjoy it) so we realised that we at least needed to offer affordable coffee grinders
                    to our customers. But we didn't stop there. We've taken our time developing the best possible collection of equipment for the casual barista who wants to get the best out of his or her coffee.</p>

                <h2>The World of Coffee</h2>
                <p>We don't just want to be a store however. Like the roasters, baristas and other coffee professionals we so admire here in the Mother City, we try to make the effort to pass on what we've learned about coffee. From coffee origins, to brew
                    methods, we do our best to share whatever information we can. You'll find lots of tidbits on the product pages themselves, and we also have some reviews & testimonials.</p>
